//  This was added in ZOOKEEPER-1783. The initial config has version 0 (not explicitly   specified by the user; the lack of version in a config file is interpreted as version=0).    As soon as a config is established we would like to increase its version so that it   takes presedence over other initial configs that were not established (such as a config   of a server trying to join the ensemble, which may be a partial view of the system, not the full config).    We chose to set the new version to the one of the NEWLEADER message. However, before we can do that   there must be agreement on the new version, so we can only change the version when sending/receiving UPTODATE,   not when sending/receiving NEWLEADER. In other words, we can't change curQV here since its the committed quorum verifier,    and there's still no agreement on the new version that we'd like to use. Instead, we use    lastSeenQuorumVerifier which is being sent with NEWLEADER message   so its a good way to let followers know about the new version. (The original reason for sending    lastSeenQuorumVerifier with NEWLEADER is so that the leader completes any potentially uncommitted reconfigs   that it finds before starting to propose operations. Here we're reusing the same code path for    reaching consensus on the new version number.)
