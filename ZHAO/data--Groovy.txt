/*     The basic strategy is an optimistic-style scheme based on    the guarantee that the hash table and its lists are always    kept in a consistent enough state to be read without locking:    * Read operations first proceed without locking, by traversing the       apparently correct list of the apparently correct bin. If an       entry is found, but not invalidated (value field null), it is       returned. If not found, operations must recheck (after a memory       barrier) to make sure they are using both the right list and       the right table (which can change under re-sizes). If       invalidated, reads must acquire main update lock to wait out       the update, and then re-traverse.    * All list additions are at the front of each bin, making it easy       to check changes, and also fast to traverse.  Entry next       pointers are never assigned. Remove() builds new nodes when       necessary to preserve this.    * Remove() (also clear()) invalidates removed nodes to alert read       operations that they must wait out the full modifications.   */

/*    * This class performs a best-effort bounding of a ConcurrentHashMap using a   * page-replacement algorithm to determine which entries to evict when the   * capacity is exceeded.   *   * The page replacement algorithm's data structures are kept eventually   * consistent with the map. An update to the map and recording of reads may   * not be immediately reflected on the algorithm's data structures. These   * structures are guarded by a lock and operations are applied in batches to   * avoid lock contention. The penalty of applying the batches is spread across   * threads so that the amortized cost is slightly higher than performing just   * the ConcurrentHashMap operation.   *   * A memento of the reads and writes that were performed on the map are   * recorded in buffers. These buffers are drained at the first opportunity   * after a write or when the read buffer exceeds a threshold size. The reads   * are recorded in a lossy buffer, allowing the reordering operations to be   * discarded if the draining process cannot keep up. Due to the concurrent   * nature of the read and write operations a strict policy ordering is not   * possible, but is observably strict when single threaded.   *   * Due to a lack of a strict ordering guarantee, a task can be executed   * out-of-order, such as a removal followed by its addition. The state of the   * entry is encoded within the value's weight.   *   * Alive: The entry is in both the hash-table and the page replacement policy.   * This is represented by a positive weight.   *   * Retired: The entry is not in the hash-table and is pending removal from the   * page replacement policy. This is represented by a negative weight.   *   * Dead: The entry is not in the hash-table and is not in the page replacement   * policy. This is represented by a weight of zero.   *   * The Least Recently Used page replacement algorithm was chosen due to its   * simplicity, high hit rate, and ability to be implemented with O(1) time   * complexity.    */
