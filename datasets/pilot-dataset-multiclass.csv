When looking for a provider JAXP looks for a service resource in the context ClassLoader which is our isolated ClassLoader. If our classpath above does not contain a      provider this returns null. If it does contain a provider JAXP extracts the classname from the service resource.   2. If not found JAXP looks for a service resource in the system ClassLoader. This happens to include all the application classes specified on the classpath. If the application      classpath does not contain a provider this returns null. If it does contain a provider JAXP extracts the implementation classname from the service resource.   3. If not found JAXP uses a default classname   4. JAXP attempts to load the provider using the context ClassLoader. which is our isolated ClassLoader. This is fine if the classname came from step 1 or 3. It blows up if the      classname came from step 2.     So as a workaround locate and make visible XML parser classes from the system classloader in our isolated ClassLoader.
